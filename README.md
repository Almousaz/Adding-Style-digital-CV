# Objective ðŸŽ¯

Bring your digital CV to life by adding CSS styling, focusing on colors, fonts, and font sizes to ensure it resonates with your unique brand.

P.S. This is a free-format exercise, allowing your creativity to shine. However, we still provide examples to guide you.

# Requirements ðŸ“‹

1. **Integrating External Styles**: Use an external CSS file for your styles. Properly link this file in your HTML for seamless integration.
2. **Utilizing Colors**: Incorporate a consistent color palette that complements the overall theme. Use contrasting colors for text and background for readability. Differentiate link colors slightly from the regular text for distinction.
3. **Styling Texts**: Enrich your textual content. At a minimum:
    - Remove the default underline in anchor tags.
    - Give emphasis to headings by using text alignment, transformations, and other text styling properties.
    - Employ text shadows where appropriate to provide depth or prominence to specific textual elements.
4. **Selecting the Font Family**: Opt for a typeface that aligns with the theme of your content. Ensure that the chosen font is legible and aesthetically pleasing. Ensure to have a fallback font in case the primary font fails to load.
5. **Selecting the Font Size**: Establish a visual hierarchy using varying font sizes. Headings should be distinguishable from body text and from each other based on their levels of importance.
6. **Using Comments**: Annotate your CSS with comments to clarify the intention behind specific styles or to provide context for future reference. This practice aids in maintaining the codebase and collaborating with others.
